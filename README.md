Adjust input and output data files while running.

Data files are uploaded in the data folder. The files are distributed in "plus" and "reg" directories representing data from EnviroPlus and Enviro sensing boards. The data files are in CSV format. However, if file size is more than 100 MB, it is compressed as RAR (eg. RPI_30) and need to be decompressed prior to using. Any compression tool can be used for this task. We used WinRar for compression. 

All data is also available on www.building-data-lite.com.
